    * Increased loot drops when playing on higher /player X modes
    * More likely to find level-appropriate gear

    * All monsters are at least 15% leechable
    * _Better/Bigger loot-splosions_
    * _Reducing or removing nextDelay from skills_
  * **Adding** graphical enhancements, cut content, and enhancements
    * Enabled cut Uniques: old Azurewrath (now Azurefury), Constricting Ring
    * Fully Equipable Mercenaries (with reduced resistances for balance)
  * **Removing** annoyances and bugs
    * 5's actually look like 5's and not weird 6's
    * Auto-skip Blizzard logo videos
    * Fixed errors in .txt files
  * **Enhancing** build diversity and crafting
